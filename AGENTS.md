Adhere to the following conventions.

Docs in `./docs/` are managed by harnez. <!-- harnez:bundled -->

- Go/Golang @docs/Go.md,
  Modern Go, avoid deps but use Cobra, add tests; use runes and display width for terminal layout
- Bash/Shell @docs/Bash.md,
  Read before multi-line shell: Make recipes, embedded scripts
  No ";", break before then/else/docs
  No "if [[]]", No "if []", Use "if test"
  smart indent!
  Use git -C/make -C, not cd
- Make/Makefile @docs/Make.md,
  ⚙️ phony sentinel, self-doc help, build dependency pattern
- Markdown @docs/Markdown.md,
  PascalCase for evergreens, kebab-case for ephemeral docs; ASCII art in chat, Mermaid only in docs/
- Git @docs/Git.md,
  conventional commits, work on the default branch, don't push unless asked
- Canary-first development @docs/Canary.md,
  probe external mechanisms before building features on them
- Spec system @docs/Spec.md,
  YAML spec files as single source of truth; Go code must not duplicate spec values
- Issue Tracking Practices @docs/IssueTracking.md,
  P0-P3 priorities, metadata headers (Status, Priority, Severity, Category), tracker sync
- Agentic Loop Practices @docs/AgenticLoop.md,
  5-phase loop (Advisory -> Dev -> Review -> Hygiene -> Retro), zero zombie guarantee
- Release Pipeline @docs/GoRelease.md,
  harnez release, version.yaml spec, GoReleaser v2, non-interactive minisign (-W), Forgejo has_releases, language-agnostic (Go/Python/Zig/Rust/scripted)
- Man Pages for Go CLIs @docs/ManPages.md,
  cobra/doc GenManTree; <cmd> man / man --install; XDG ~/.local/share/man/man1

## Harnez Managed Conventions

Managed by harnez — local edits here are overwritten on the next `harnez init`.
Put project-specific rules outside this block.

### Editing Discipline
- Prefer structured patch tools (`apply_patch`) or whole-block replacements over
  narrow string substitution edits.
- When making multi-line edits, ensure sufficient surrounding context lines to
  avoid ambiguous pattern matches.

### Issue Tracker Discovery (harnez find)
Applies when this project has an `issues/` tracker. To search existing issues,
compute the next ticket number, or allocate one, use `harnez find` / `harnez issues`
instead of `ls issues/`, `find`, or raw grep:
- `harnez find -d <repo> issues -a status:open` — list active open issues
- `harnez find -d <repo> issues "<query>"` — fuzzy search across titles and body text
- `harnez find -d <repo> issues next` — report the next free ticket number (read-only)
- `harnez issues new -d <repo> "<title>"` — atomically reserve that number and create
  a placeholder ticket file; write the ticket to the printed path
- `harnez issues <verb> -d <repo> <n> [reason]` — change a ticket's status, resync
  `issues/README.md`, and commit, in one call
- `harnez index -d <repo>` — update `issues/README.md` after filing or updating tickets
- Commit documentation and `issues/*.md` changes immediately; don't batch them behind
  pending code work.

### Agentic Loop Invariants
Where `@docs/AgenticLoop.md` is present in this project, follow it rather than
restating it here — in particular Invariant 1 (Parallel Read, Sequential Write:
one writer per workspace), Invariant 3 (Zero Zombie Guarantee: track and terminate
every background task and subagent), Invariant 6 (Context Discipline: no whole-file
reads of AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md — grep or range-bounded reads), and Invariant 7
(Media & Demo Verification Gate: explicit user confirmation before publishing
recordings or screenshots).

<!-- harnez:begin Quota-1 Guardrails -->
## Quota-1 Guardrails

- **Single-Test Boundary**: Under Quota-1 rules, the agent may only run the test suite once per step/turn.
- **Code Modification Required**: If tests fail or complete, you MUST modify repository source files before running tests again. Repeated test runs without intermediate code modifications are blocked.
- **Enforced Test Target**: Execute tests via `make test-q1` (or `harnez exec --quota-1 -- <test-cmd>`).
- **Unauthorized Bypass Forbidden**: Bypassing guardrails via `QUOTA_BYPASS=1` or `HARNEZ_QUOTA_BYPASS=1` is strictly reserved for human developers and CI environments. Agent loops must not set or pass bypass flags.
